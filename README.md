# üìÑ PDF Search Engine

PDF Search Engine is keyword-based PDF search engine with fully functioning logical operations, trie autocomplete, graph-based ranking and highlighted key-word exports.

Evaluating Search Engine performance is accomplished using Data Structures and Algorithms in Python book which can be found in [public directory](./public).

<a name="specification"><a/>
## üìå Specification:

1. **Pre-Indexing**

The system processes the PDF document upon startup, extracting data from text into efficient data structures for quick retrieval.

2. **Ranked Search Results**

Results are ranked based on keyword occurrences. Additional ranking heuristics include keyword density and relative importance.

3. **Multi-Word Queries**

Users can enter one or more words separated by spaces. Pages containing all words are prioritized over partial matches. Frequency of each word in the document affects ranking.

4. **Logical Operators**

Supports AND, OR, NOT for complex query logic.

5. **Pagination**

Displays a limited number of results per page. Users can navigate through pages to view more results.

6. **Graph-Based Ranking**

Uses references within the document (e.g., "See page X") to improve ranking. Pages referenced frequently by other pages gain higher ranking.

7. **Trie-Based Indexing**

Uses a Trie (prefix tree) for fast word lookup, allows efficient autocomplete and prefix searches, reduces search time compared to traditional list-based approaches.

8. **Auto-Complete & Suggestions**

Provides query completion based on indexed words. "Did you mean?" feature suggests alternative words if the query has few or no results.

9. **PDF Export & Highlighting**

Allows users to save search results as a separate PDF file, extracted pages with relevant matches are compiled into a new document, highlights keywords in the exported PDF for easier identification.

<a name="start"><a/>
## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
    Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:


   ```bash
   https://github.com/vasicm4/pdf-search-engine.git
    ```
    Alternatively, download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Installation of additional libraries and dependencies**:
   - Open terminal or command prompt based on operating system
   - Navigate to the folder where the repository is located
   - Insert `pip install -r requirements.txt` in terminal
   
   Alternatively you can execute `pip install pypdf PyMuPDF`

3. **Run the program**:
    - To start the program type `python source/main.py` in your terminal

4. **Make a choice and enter desired query**:
    - You can enter anything you want, but try to stay within context of the file for optimal results.
    
    Here are a few examples of good inputs:
        
        tree
        python AND node
        python NOT value

    Here are some of them with unoptimal results:
        
        sunflower
        corn AND pasta
        airoplane NOT water

<a name="functionalities"><a/>
## üí° Functionalities
   
  Upon starting the program a simple menu with 3 options appear, by inserting one of the numbers you can:
    
1. search for a query
2. view a guide
3. exit the program

There are multiple search options available:

1. [Single/Multiple Word Search](#word-search)
2. [Phrase Search](#phrase)
3. [Logical Operations](#logical-operations)
4. [Autocomplete](#autocomplete)

They will all be listed subsequently

<a name="word-search"><a/>
## üîç Single/Multi Word Search

On entering a query, the system scans the document and created data structures for ranked results, after which it displays them based on it's value.

### Page Ranking

- **Keyword Appearance:** more occurences - higher rank
- **Page Reference:** if another page references the current one, it's rank increases
- **Distinct keywords bonus**: More unique keywords = better ranking.


### Example Queries:

    python
    node 
    linked list

<a name="phrase"><a/>
## üîç Phrase Search
   
   Phrase search allows users to look for an exact sequence of words (phrase) by enclosing them in double quotes (").
   
   ### Example Query:
If you enter a phrase:

    "linked list"
    
The system will only return results where "linked list" appears exactly as written, rather than separate occurrences of "linked" and "list" on the same page. This ensures that the search retrieves only results where the words appear together in the correct order.

Below is an example of phrase search results:

<a name="logical-operations"><a/>
## üîç Logical Operations

Search Engine allows users to filter query entries using logical operators `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` where:
 - `AND` - returns results that contain both words 
 - `OR` - returns results that contain either of words inserted
 - `NOT` - returns pages that don't contain particular entry
 
 It is possible for users to group multiple logical operations by using brackets ( )

### Example Queries:


    python AND node
    linked OR tree
    node NOT tree
    python AND node NOT tree
    python OR (linked AND list)
    
These queries will return results based on previous definitions of logical operators `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`.

### Example


***
<a name="autocomplete"><a/>
## üîç Autocomplete

Search engine provides us autocomplete suggestions when we insert * at the end of our query. This helps us optimize search results without typing the whole word we want to look for. 


   ### Example Query: 
   
    lin*
    
   ### Results:
   ```
    1. linked
    2. linear
    3. line
    4. linkedbinarytree
    5. lines
    6. link
    7. linkedqueue
    8. links
    9. linkedstack
    10. linking
    11. linda
    12. linkeddeque
   ```
   
   ### Word Choice:
  Next step is to choose one of the words via typing a number that is right in front of it.
  
  `Enter the number of the word you want to search: 3`
  
  This choice will trigger [Single Word Search](#single-word) for the word `line`
